# Flask-Boilerplate
- It provides a basic dir structure to kick start a project having multiple Flask applications.
- If one wants to create multiple apps under a project, then like `demo` multiple apps can be created.  
`NOTE:` These root level apps are completely different apps belong to a project, which means they should not interact with each other.
- To learn about the existence of each dir follow their respective README files or available wiki.
